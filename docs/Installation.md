## Installer

If you're using the installer, visit [TODO], for the guide and download.

## Setup

To get a working VAL-Application, you need three parts.

1. [VAL-Frontend](https://github.com/Haugalandet/VAL-Frontend)
2. [VAL-Backend](https://github.com/Haugalandet/VAL-Backend)
3. PostgreSQL database

The installation/setup guide for the frontend and backend, can be found at their respective readme.

For this example, we will use an docker image of PostgreSQL.
